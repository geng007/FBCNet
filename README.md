Welcome to the GitHub code library for the paper "From WSI-level to Patch level: Structure Prior - Guided Binuclear Cell Fine grained Detection". This repository contains the code implementation of our proposed method for detecting binuclear cells in histopathology images. Our approach uses structure prior guidance and operates at both whole slide image (WSI) and patch levels. We believe that this code library will be a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in advancing the field of medical image analysis, particularly in the area of histopathology image analysis. Our hope is that this repository will encourage further research and development of methods that can improve the accuracy and efficiency of cell detection in medical images.
